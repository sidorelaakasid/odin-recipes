    <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>Tomato Bacon Pasta is a quintessential example of how to make a quick pasta dish thatâ€™s totally slurp-worthy with just a few ingredients. All you need is bacon, canned tomato, pasta and a few pantry staples!</p>
        


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>

         <li>bacon (or pancetta, speck, chorizo, ham or sausage)</li>
         <li>a can of tomato</li>
         <l1>olive oil, garlic and pasta</l1>

      </ul>


      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>

        <li>Bring a large pot of water to the bowl. Add a pinch of salt. Cook pasta according to packet but MINUS 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add bacon and cook for 1 minute, then add garlic and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until onion is translucent and bacon is golden. Drain excess fat if desired.</li>
        <li>Add tomato, bring to simmer and cook for 2 minutes, then turn down to medium high.</li>
        <li>Toss gently using two wooden spoons for 2 minutes, or until the sauce is no longer sitting in the skillet, it's all on the pasta (see video). If it gets too thick, just add an extra splash of the pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parmesan, parsley and final drizzle of olive oil if desired.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3><strong><em>Toss the pasta in the sauce with a splash of pasta cooking water. This is how restaurants make even the simplest of pastas taste so amazing!</em></strong></h3>
